# Wilsons Import React
 
 ## About this Project 
This is my first published react website that was designed and developed myself, It is a mock business site for a trucking company. This was the first time taking on the BEM methodology with SCSS. Coupled with my technologies I also used React-Router, Framer motion and React Icons to finish this website. 

You can access the website here.
